# Authentication & User Management Learning Plan

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Understand JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and their role in authentication
- Learn password hashing and security best practices
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Design user profiles with fitness data
- Integrate AI recommendations

## üìö Core Concepts to Master

### 1. Authentication Fundamentals
- [ ] **What is JWT?** - Understand the structure (header.payload.signature)
- [ ] **Token-based vs Session-based auth** - Learn the differences and trade-offs
- [ ] **Password Security** - Why hashing matters and how bcrypt works
- [ ] **Middleware Pattern** - How to protect routes in Go

### 2. Database Design
- [ ] **User Table Design** - Plan the schema for users, roles, and profiles
- [ ] **Foreign Key Relationships** - Connect users to their workouts
- [ ] **Data Validation** - Ensure data integrity at the database level

### 3. Go-Specific Implementation
- [ ] **JWT Library** - Learn to use `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt`
- [ ] **Password Hashing** - Implement bcrypt with `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt`
- [ ] **Middleware Functions** - Create authentication middleware
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Proper HTTP status codes and error responses

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: User Authentication Foundation
1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Add JWT and bcrypt packages to go.mod
   - Understand what each package provides

2. **Design User Model**
   - Create User struct with fields: ID, Email, PasswordHash, Role, CreatedAt
   - Think about: What fields are required? What should be optional?

3. **Database Schema**
   - Design users table
   - Consider: How will you handle role-based permissions?
   - Plan: How will users relate to workouts?

4. **Password Hashing**
   - Implement bcrypt hashing for registration
   - Implement password verification for login
   - Research: What's the difference between hashing and encryption?

### Phase 2: JWT Implementation
1. **Token Generation**
   - Create JWT with user claims (ID, email, role)
   - Set appropriate expiration times
   - Question: How long should tokens be valid?

2. **Token Validation**
   - Create middleware to verify JWT tokens
   - Extract user information from tokens
   - Handle: What happens when tokens expire?

3. **Authentication Endpoints**
   - `/api/auth/register` - User registration
   - `/api/auth/login` - User login
   - `/api/auth/refresh` - Token refresh (bonus)

### Phase 3: User Profiles & Roles
1. **User Profile Model**
   - Fitness goals, experience level, body metrics
   - Design: How will you store complex fitness data?

2. **Role-Based Access**
   - Implement role checking middleware
   - Define permissions for each role
   - Question: What can each role do differently?

3. **Profile Management**
   - CRUD operations for user profiles
   - Validation: Ensure data quality

### Phase 4: AI Integration
1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather user workout history
   - Analyze patterns and preferences
   - Consider: What data is most valuable for recommendations?

2. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Basic recommendation algorithms
   - Integration with external AI services
   - Plan: How will you measure recommendation quality?

## üîç Key Questions to Research

### Security
- What are the security implications of storing JWTs in localStorage vs cookies?
- How do you handle token refresh securely?
- What's the difference between JWT and session-based authentication?

### Database Design
- How should you handle user deletion (soft delete vs hard delete)?
- What's the best way to store user preferences and settings?
- How do you handle data privacy and GDPR compliance?

### Performance
- How do you optimize JWT validation for high-traffic applications?
- What's the impact of JWT size on network performance?
- How do you handle database connections efficiently?

## üéØ Next Steps
1. Start with Phase 1 - focus on understanding the concepts before coding
2. Research JWT structure and security considerations
3. Plan your database schema on paper first
4. Implement one feature at a time, testing thoroughly
5. Ask questions about any concepts you don't understand!

Remember: Security is critical in authentication systems. Take your time to understand the concepts before implementing them.
