# Authentication Concepts Deep Dive

## üîê What is Authentication?

**Authentication** is the process of verifying who someone is. Think of it like showing your ID at a gym - you prove you're a member before you can enter.

### Key Questions to Understand:
- How do you prove your identity to a computer system?
- What happens if someone steals your "proof"?
- How do you keep your proof secure?

## üé´ JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Explained

### What is a JWT?
A JWT is like a digital passport that contains information about you. It has three parts:

```
Header.Payload.Signature
```

**Think of it like this:**
- **Header**: Contains metadata (like "this is a passport")
- **Payload**: Contains your information (like your name, role, expiration date)
- **Signature**: A seal that proves the passport is authentic (like a hologram)

### JWT Structure Example:
```json
// Header
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

// Payload
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "user",
  "exp": 1640995200
}

// Signature (encrypted with a secret key)
HMACSHA256(base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload), secret)
```

### Key Questions:
- Why do we need all three parts?
- What happens if someone modifies the payload?
- How does the signature prevent tampering?

## üîí Password Security: Hashing vs Encryption

### What is Hashing?
Hashing is a one-way process that converts a password into a fixed-length string.

**Example:**
```
Password: "mypassword123"
Hash: "$2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy"
```

### Why Hash Passwords?
- **One-way**: You can't reverse the hash to get the original password
- **Deterministic**: Same password always produces the same hash
- **Salt**: Adds random data to prevent rainbow table attacks

### Questions to Research:
- What's the difference between hashing and encryption?
- Why do we add "salt" to passwords?
- What is a rainbow table attack?

## üõ°Ô∏è Middleware Pattern

### What is Middleware?
Middleware is code that runs between a request and response. Think of it like security checkpoints.

**Flow:**
```
Request ‚Üí Middleware 1 ‚Üí Middleware 2 ‚Üí Handler ‚Üí Response
```

### Authentication Middleware Example:
```go
func AuthMiddleware(next http.HandlerFunc) http.HandlerFunc {
    return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        // 1. Extract token from request
        // 2. Validate token
        // 3. If valid, call next handler
        // 4. If invalid, return error
    }
}
```

### Key Questions:
- What happens if middleware fails?
- How do you pass user data between middleware and handlers?
- When should you use middleware vs checking in handlers?

## üë• Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### What is RBAC?
RBAC determines what users can do based on their role.

**Example Roles:**
- **User**: Can log workouts, view own profile
- **Trainer**: Can view client workouts, create programs
- **Admin**: Can manage users, view all data

### Implementation Questions:
- How do you store roles in the database?
- How do you check permissions in code?
- What happens if a user's role changes?

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design Concepts

### User Table Design
Think about what information you need to store:

```sql
-- Basic user information
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user',
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- User profile information
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    fitness_goals TEXT,
    experience_level TEXT,
    height REAL,
    weight REAL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

### Key Design Questions:
- Should you store all user data in one table or split it?
- How do you handle optional profile fields?
- What's the best way to store complex data like fitness goals?

## üîÑ Token Lifecycle

### Token Flow:
1. **Login**: User provides credentials ‚Üí Server validates ‚Üí Server creates JWT
2. **Request**: Client sends JWT with each request
3. **Validation**: Server checks JWT signature and expiration
4. **Response**: Server processes request or returns error

### Important Questions:
- How long should tokens be valid?
- What happens when a token expires?
- How do you handle token refresh?

## üö® Security Considerations

### Common Vulnerabilities:
- **Token Storage**: Where should you store JWTs on the client?
- **Token Size**: Large tokens increase network overhead
- **Token Expiration**: Too long = security risk, too short = poor UX
- **Secret Management**: How do you keep your JWT secret secure?

### Questions to Research:
- What's the difference between localStorage and httpOnly cookies?
- How do you handle logout with JWTs?
- What are the security implications of storing sensitive data in JWT payload?

## üß† AI Integration Concepts

### Data Collection for AI:
- **User Behavior**: What workouts do they prefer?
- **Progress Tracking**: How do their metrics change over time?
- **Goals**: What are they trying to achieve?

### Recommendation Types:
- **Content-based**: Recommend similar exercises to what they've done
- **Collaborative**: Recommend what similar users like
- **Hybrid**: Combine multiple approaches

### Questions to Explore:
- What data is most valuable for recommendations?
- How do you measure recommendation quality?
- How do you handle cold start (new users with no data)?

## üéØ Understanding Check

Before implementing, ask yourself:

1. **JWT Understanding**: Can you explain what each part of a JWT does?
2. **Security**: Why is password hashing important?
3. **Database**: How would you design tables for users and their profiles?
4. **Middleware**: How would you protect a route that requires authentication?
5. **Roles**: How would you implement different permissions for different user types?

## üîç Research Tasks

1. **JWT Security**: Research JWT best practices and common vulnerabilities
2. **Password Security**: Learn about bcrypt, salt, and rainbow table attacks
3. **Database Design**: Study normalization and foreign key relationships
4. **Go Web Development**: Understand HTTP handlers and middleware patterns
5. **AI Basics**: Learn about recommendation systems and machine learning concepts

Remember: Understanding these concepts deeply will help you build a secure and scalable authentication system!
